# Build VM Image

First off, open up a cloud shell.  While you could do this on your local machine with gcloud, it's way easier to just use a cloud shell.

Now we need to decide what OS image to use.  We're using the latest Ubuntu 14.04.  You can figure out what that is by running:

    gcloud compute images list
    IMAGE_VERSION=v20100411
    IMAGE_NAME=ubuntu-1604-trusty-${IMAGE_VERSION}

Next, create an image for each license:

    LICENSES=( \
      couchbase-server-ee-byol \
      couchbase-sync-gateway-ee-byol \
      couchbase-server-ee-hourly-pricing \
      couchbase-sync-gateway-ee-hourly-pricing \
    )

    for LICENSE in "${LICENSES[@]}"
    do
      INSTANCE=${LICENSE}-${IMAGE_VERSION}
      gcloud compute instances create ${INSTANCE} \
        --project "couchbase-public" \
        --zone "us-central1-f" \
        --machine-type "n1-standard-8" \
        --network "default" \
        --maintenance-policy "MIGRATE" \
        --scopes default="https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform" \
        --image "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ubuntu-os-cloud/global/images/${IMAGE_NAME}" --boot-disk-size "20" \
        --boot-disk-type "pd-standard" \
        --boot-disk-device-name ${INSTANCE} \
        --no-boot-disk-auto-delete \
        --scopes "storage-rw"
    done

Now we're going to delete all four VMs.  We'll be left with their boot disks.  This command takes a few minutes to run and doesn't print anything.  

    for LICENSE in "${LICENSES[@]}"
    do
      INSTANCE=${LICENSE}-${IMAGE_VERSION}
      gcloud compute instances delete ${INSTANCE} \
        --project "couchbase-public" \
        --zone "us-central1-f"
    done

We were previously piping yes, but that doesn't seem to be working currently, so you'll have to type "y" a few times.

Now you need to attach the license ID to each image.  That process is described [here](https://cloud.google.com/launcher/docs/partners/technical-components#create_the_base_solution_vm).  
Note that you do not need to mount the disks and delete files since none were created.  To start, install the partner utilities:

    mkdir partner-utils
    cd partner-utils
    curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/c2d-install-scripts/partner-utils.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf partner-utils.tar.gz
    sudo python setup.py install

Now apply the license:

    for LICENSE in "${LICENSES[@]}"
    do
      INSTANCE=${LICENSE}-${IMAGE_VERSION}
      python image_creator.py \
        --project couchbase-public \
        --disk ${INSTANCE} \
        --name ${INSTANCE} \
        --description ${INSTANCE} \
        --destination-project couchbase-public \
        --license couchbase-public/${LICENSE}
    done

The license ID for ubuntu-os-cloud/ubuntu-1404-trusty should be attached by default.

# Create Deployment Package

To create the deployment package run

    ./makeArchives.sh

You'll upload archive-byol.zip and archive-hourly-pricing.zip in the portal at a later point in this process.

## 6 - Deployment Package

### Configure Deployment Package
Select "Upload a package" and upload the zip you created with [markArchives.sh](makeArchives.sh) earlier.  With this complete you can test and publish the offer.  You may want to upload the package before configuring anything else since it sometimes clobbers others changes in the portal.  This package upload will clobber the solution name, so BYOL will need to be renamed after upload.
